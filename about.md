Kiip IT Reaal provide hands-on expertise in electronics, software, and systems audits.

**Services include**:
- Embedded software development
- Computer engineering at lower levels (C, C++, Python, Linux systems)
- Technical due diligence/audits
- Technology/programming classes and teaching

**Why keep it real?**
- 15+ years of hands-on experience in **software, computer systems and electronics**
- Real-world knowledge across **startups and scale-ups** (worked in 6 very different companies)
- No vendor fluff — just independent, fast, and practical insights
- I know that there is no universal process that works for every case. One has to develop processes that solve actual business problems in most efficient way for a company

I started as a regular folk, with no mainstream computer programming approach:
- I did not (do not) play computer games
- No programming at leisure time (prefer to do sports and sleep)
- Value time on and off screen so no entertainment during screen time

My background/roots:
- Building speakers(woofers)
- Simple electronics - audio setups, connecting motors, lights, formating Windows etc.
- Interested in math and physics but not for grades
- Fishing
- Sports
- Graduated high school at "Regular Joe" level

This has enabled me to embrace the craft and stay humble. Often people act braggadocious and cocky when talking technology or programming.
Unfortunately same attitude can be seen in classes and lectures. There was a feeling that this approach does not suit "regular folks", so I adapted
and learned everything from bottom at my own pace, intuition and interests. This "novice background" is actually one of my strongest assets.
Because I had to figure things out without shortcuts or insider jargon, I know how to explain complex topics clearly, without condescension.
Whether it's reviewing someone’s system, writing low-level code, or teaching a beginner, I approach it with patience, empathy, and clarity.
That makes a real difference—especially in areas where technology often feels opaque or intimidating. That is the reason why I can recognize hype
very well. I have worked with "rock star level" developers and taken notes, but also learning how hard it would be to collaborate with people
with expert skills. It takes a lot of effort to learn and understand but when the tone is set right, mood and energy is high - people are built
to achieve (almost) everything.
