# Technical Audit Report

**Client**: *StartupX Inc.*  
**Date**: April 2025  
**Auditor**: [Your Name or Company Name]  
**Audit Type**: Full Tech Due Diligence  
**Scope**: Codebase, CI/CD, Architecture, Team Process, Security

---

## 1. Executive Summary

StartupX has a solid engineering foundation, but there are areas of technical risk that should be addressed before scaling further or undergoing acquisition. The codebase reflects a competent team, but lacks clear modularity and has signs of growing technical debt. CI/CD pipelines are functional but underutilized. There are minor but fixable security issues.

**Overall Technical Risk**: Moderate  
**Scalability Readiness**: Needs Work  
**Security Posture**: Fair  
**Team Maturity**: Solid but reactive

## 2. Codebase Health

**Languages**: TypeScript (Node.js), React, PostgreSQL  
**LOC (Lines of Code)**: ~70,000  
**Repo Structure**: Monorepo

**Findings**:
- **Modularity**: Business logic tightly coupled with API layer — hard to test or reuse.
- **Tests**: Low unit test coverage (~22%), mostly integration tests.
- **Technical Debt**: Several legacy features are flagged as “do not touch” by engineers.
- **Tooling**: ESLint and Prettier in place, but inconsistently applied.

**Recommendations**:
- Refactor core modules into isolated services or libraries.
- Enforce automated linting and testing in CI.
- Add test coverage metrics to track progress.

---

## 3. CI/CD & DevOps

**Platform**: GitHub Actions + Vercel  
**Deployment Frequency**: Weekly (manual prod deploys)

**Findings**:
- CI handles tests and linting but fails silently on some branches.
- No rollback mechanism or canary releases.
- Environment secrets are managed manually.

**Recommendations**:
- Add health checks and auto-fail gates on broken builds.
- Use feature flags for safer rollouts.
- Introduce secret management via GitHub Actions + Vault or Doppler.

## 4. Architecture Review

**Backend**: REST API with some GraphQL  
**Frontend**: React SPA  
**Infra**: Vercel + Supabase + Cloudflare

**Findings**:
- Latency spikes under simulated load (~100 concurrent users).
- Limited observability — no metrics dashboards or alerts.
- Good use of managed services, but vendor lock-in risk with Supabase.

**Recommendations**:
- Add application metrics (e.g. Prometheus + Grafana, or Sentry).
- Consider load testing before user acquisition campaigns.
- Evaluate Supabase alternatives or backup/export strategy.

---

## 5. Security Overview

- No obvious OWASP Top 10 issues detected in scan.
- Dependency scanning (via `npm audit`) not automated.
- Several public GitHub repos have exposed `.env.example` with clues to infra.

**Recommendations**:
- Set up automatic security scanning for packages.
- Audit all public repos for info leaks.
- Educate devs on “secrets hygiene.”

---

## 6. Team & Process

**Team Size**: 6 Engineers  
**Workflow**: GitHub Flow, Slack, Jira

**Findings**:
- Good code review habits — 1–2 reviewers per PR.
- Post-mortems are ad hoc, not documented.
- Dev onboarding takes ~1 week; lacks structured guide.

**Recommendations**:
- Create lightweight runbooks and onboarding docs.
- Schedule regular retros for systemic improvements.

## 7. Summary Table

| Category        | Risk Level | Priority | Action Items                             |
|----------------|------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| Codebase        | Moderate   | High     | Refactor core modules, enforce lint/tests |
| CI/CD           | Low        | Medium   | Improve reliability & automation          |
| Architecture    | Moderate   | High     | Add observability, test load readiness    |
| Security        | Low        | Medium   | Scan dependencies, clean up repos         |
| Team & Process  | Low        | Low      | Add onboarding docs, formalize retros     |

## Final Notes

StartupX is well-positioned technically but needs to harden its practices as it grows. If planning for funding or acquisition, addressing key areas like test coverage, scalability, and basic security hygiene will significantly reduce risk for investors and improve long-term velocity.
