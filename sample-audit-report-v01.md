# Technical Audit Report

**Client**: *Wisefy 24/7*  
**Date**: April 2025\
**Auditor**: Kiip IT Reaal  
**Audit Type**: Full Tech Due Diligence
**Scope**: Codebase, CI/CD, Team Process

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Wisefy 24/7 has a solid engineering foundation, but there are areas of technical risk that should be addressed before scaling further or undergoing acquisition. The codebase reflects a competent team, but lacks clear modularity and has signs of growing technical debt. CI/CD pipelines are functional but underutilized. There are minor but fixable security issues.

**Overall Technical Risk**: Moderate  
**Scalability Readiness**: Needs Work  
**Security Posture**: Fair  
**Team Maturity**: Solid but reactive

## 2. Codebase Health

### Product Wiseman

**Languages**: C++, Python, Bash
**LOC (Lines of Code)**: ~70,000  

**Findings**:
- **Modularity**: Business logic tightly coupled between Python and C++ modules — hard to test or reuse.
- **Tests**: Low unit test coverage (~22%), mostly integration tests.
- **Technical Debt**: Several legacy features are flagged as “do not touch” by engineers.
- **Tooling**: Linters and sanitizers in place, but inconsistently applied.

**Recommendations**:
- Refactor core modules into isolated services or libraries.
- Enforce automated linting and testing in CI.
- Add test coverage metrics to track progress.
- Use LLM based tools to generate documentation and assist with the codebase

### Infrastructure Support

**Frameworks**: Docker, Ansible 
**Cloud Services**: AWS (EC2, S3, CloudWatch, Lambda)

**Findings**:
- Partially automated, fragile deployments  
- Basic logging; no centralized aggregation  
- Secrets occasionally stored in plaintext  
- No Budgets, No alerts/SNS

---

## 3. CI/CD & DevOps

**Platform**: GitHub Actions
**Deployment Frequency**: Weekly (manual prod deploys)

**Findings**:
- CI handles tests and linting but fails silently on some branches.
- Some of the suites are simply done just for the purpose of being present, not much integrity.
- Environment secrets are managed manually.

**Recommendations**:
- Add health checks and auto-fail gates on broken builds.
- Use feature flags for safer rollouts.
- Introduce secret management via GitHub Actions + Vault or Doppler.
- Create more real use-case oriented E2E tests

---

## 4. Team & Process

**Team Size**: 6 Engineers  
**Workflow**: GitHub, Slack, Jira

**Findings**:
- Good code review habits — 1–2 reviewers per PR.
- Tasks are often too big or not well defined and taking too long
- Not everyone share same values
- Dev onboarding takes fast, only couple of days, standard approaches and tools are utilized

**Recommendations**:
- Schedule regular retros for systemic improvements.
- Automate testing, linting e.g. CI pipelines more for less developer intervention

## 5. Summary Table

| Category        | Risk Level | Priority | Action Items                             |
|----------------|------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| Codebase        | Moderate   | High     | Refactor core modules, enforce lint/tests |
| CI/CD           | Low        | Medium   | Improve integrity, add E2E tests          |
| Team & Process  | Moderate   | Low      | Either automate more or replace some devs with team players |

## Final Notes

Wisefy 24/7 is well-positioned technically but needs to harden its practices as it grows. If planning for funding or acquisition, addressing key areas like test coverage/integrity and infra scalability will significantly reduce risk for investors and improve long-term velocity.
There is some cap to cut development workforce to decrease salary pressure while making team chemistry better. 

I see the CEO as risk, since the product is purely technical with embedded/electronics components, but the high lever processes are run like a regular App development company.
The general direction of the company seems to be reactive not proactive.
